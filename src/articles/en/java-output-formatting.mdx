![Java Output Formatting](/images/thumb-hackerrank-java-output-formatting.png)

Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using printf.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor; you must format and print the input to complete the solution.

### Input Format

Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of **10** alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from **0** to **999**.

### Output Format

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly **15** characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly **3** digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

### Sample Input

```Java
java 100
cpp 65
python 50
```
### Sample Output

```Java
================================
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
================================
```

### Explanation

Each String is left-justified with trailing whitespace through the first  **15** characters. The leading digit of the integer is the **16^th** character, and each integer that was less than **3** digits now has leading zeroes.

### Let's solve the problem

First let's look at the initial code provided to us by the challenge.

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("================================");
            for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
            {
                String s1=sc.next();
                int x=sc.nextInt();
                //Complete this line
            }
            System.out.println("================================");

    }
}
```

Maybe you noticed that the code is already 95% complete, to solve it we will just write one line of code.

We will need to understand String formatting, in this case we will add a size to the string using **%[width]**.

See below, I'm using printf to print the values of **s1* and **x** and the end of line ***System.out.printf("%s%d\n", s1, x) ;***, but we need to add a space between the string and the 15-character integer to the right of the string, for this we must do ***%-15s***, thus resulting in ***System.out.printf(" %-15s%d\n", s1, x);***, there is one more step, we have to print zeros on the left for cases where the integer has less than 3 decimal places, to do this just do the following **%03d** this fills the number of remaining decimal places with the value zero until completing 3 decimal places, now we have the following formatting mask **System.out.printf("%-15s%03d\n", s1 , x);**.

So the end result was like this.

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("================================");
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            String s1 = sc.next();
            int x = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.printf("%-15s%03d\n", s1, x);
        }
        System.out.println("================================");
    }
}
```
